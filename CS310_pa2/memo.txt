1. Discuss your experiences in writing these programs.  
What was the hardest part for you?  
Are you now a hashing expert?  
Have you thought of any applications of hashing in problems you have seen outside this class?

2. Explain how JDK documentation for Map (or what else) guided you to decide which methods 
you needed to make private.

3. Explain in your own words what it means that the keySet is a view on the JDK HashSet.

4. Report on experiments with TestMapPerf, showing one final run’s output.  
Does your data agree with the O(1) claim of hashing?  
How do your HashMap2 compare to JDK’s? 
Did switching to SequentialSearchST hurt performance? 
How does JDK HashMap compare to JDK TreeMap?
